## About
This is a repo of all the sily JavaScript things that I come up with.    
Here, in every branch I show you just how customizable JavaScript is.    
This code is meant to do silly, complicated, or cool things.    
Consider this a free RnD project of one guy who wrote vanila JavaScript for 6 years.

Upgrades are welcome too.
Every branch has a copy of the permissive free licence .
