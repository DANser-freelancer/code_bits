## About
This is a repo of all the sily javascript things that I come up with.    
Here, in every branch I show you just how customizable javascript is.     
**Let's cook.     
Let's cast some spells.    
Let's go ahead and try to break it, spin it, slam it, have fun.**     
This code is meant to do silly and cool things.

Upgrades are welcome too.
