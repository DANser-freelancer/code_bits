`function` declarations in javascript are `hoisted`.       
- the function is interpeted and appended to the top of the enclosing function/global scope
- this happens before the scope starts execution        

This can be used to mimick Haskell functionality of [where](https://kiru.io/blog/posts/2024/dear-language-designers-please-copy-where-from-haskell/).
